# sticky-notes

This is an app for writing and saving sticky notes, built with React. This was a course project in the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) React course.

I went beyond the assigned project by practicing TDD as I created this App.  I utilized Jest with React Testing Library, which was a joy to work with.  (It just worked, straight out of the box!)  Coverage is 100%.  I tried to follow Testing Library's guiding principle that "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you." ([Kent Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)).  Accordingly, I prioritized tests that reflect the experience of visual/mouse users (as well as those that use assistive technology) over tests that utilize code identifiers hidden to the end user.

In working on this project, I discovered the [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/), which was an amazing tool in helping me to choose queries that most closely resembled user experience.
